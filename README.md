# arche-VS-code-extension
VS code extension for [Arche](https://github.com/richytong/arche)

Currently supports  A, Button, Div, Input, Img, P, Span.

Here's a [loom demo](https://www.loom.com/share/82338dd3b73445d29ec34921138f55da) of how it works.

Install the extension locally by copying and pasting the contents of arche.code-snippets in this repository to a file in your VS code environment. You can name the file whatever you'd like, but it's best to use the same name: arche.code-snippets.
